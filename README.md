## Strategy
----------------
__Project goals__

The aim of this project is to build a site for a fictional start-up company and enable the company to create a professional and effective online presence. 
It was important for me to create a user-friendly and modern design site, that in effect inticed the user to discover more about the content
and in turn learn about the company. Overall, it was imperative to display information and content relevant to the company through well structured design,
positive imagery and colour. 

With regard to the content of the site, I aimed to answer four key questions that the company wanted users to be able to answer on landing and navigating the site.
- **_What_** are the services that company provide?
- **_Why_** would we choose this company, are they working within our specific area of expertise? 
- **_How_** will this company help our needs? **_How_** much experience do they have? 
- **_Where_** are the company based, are they operating on the island of Ireland?
 
__Customer goals__ 

The customer or users goals will be met by answering the questions posed earlier. The users want an informative, responsive and efficient website.
The users want basic information with an opportunity to learn more if they wish. This will be achieved through easily digestible snippets of text, combined 
with modern imagery to re-enforce the information.
